## Problem Statement
Farmers in Bangladesh face significant challenges in selling their produce at fair prices due to exploitation by middlemen, lack of market transparency, and limited access to direct buyers. As a result, farmers often receive lower profits while consumers pay inflated prices for the same products.

To address this issue, we propose AgriConnect, a digital marketplace that directly connects farmers with buyers and retailers. This system ensures fair pricing, secure transactions, and reliable communication between stakeholders. The platform will include features such as direct crop listing by farmers, a bidding system for bulk buyers, product reviews, secure digital payments (bKash/Nagad), and live chat functionality to facilitate negotiations. Additionally, an admin panel will monitor marketplace activity and ensure a transparent trading environment.

By eliminating middlemen and providing real-time market insights, AgriConnect empowers farmers, enhances buyer trust, and creates a sustainable, fair-trade ecosystem in the agricultural sector.
