### **Problem Statement for AgriConnect â€“ A Fair Price Farmer Marketplace**  

Farmers in Bangladesh face significant challenges in selling their produce at fair prices due to **exploitation by middlemen**, **lack of market transparency**, and **limited access to direct buyers**. As a result, farmers often receive lower profits while consumers pay inflated prices for the same products. 

To address this issue, we propose **AgriConnect**, a digital marketplace that directly connects **farmers with buyers and retailers**. This system ensures **fair pricing, secure transactions, and reliable communication** between stakeholders. The platform will include features such as **direct crop listing by farmers, a bidding system for bulk buyers, product reviews, secure digital payments (bKash/Nagad), and live chat functionality** to facilitate negotiations. Additionally, an admin panel will monitor marketplace activity and ensure a transparent trading environment.

By eliminating middlemen and providing real-time market insights, **AgriConnect empowers farmers**, enhances buyer trust, and creates a **sustainable, fair-trade ecosystem** in the agricultural sector. ðŸš€
